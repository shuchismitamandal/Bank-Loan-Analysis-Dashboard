# 📊Bank Loan Analysis Dashboard
A dynamic, interactive Power BI dashboard built to analyze bank loan applications, funding performance, and borrower risk—focusing on loan quality, repayment trends, and borrower characteristics such as purpose, employment, and home ownership.

## 🎯Purpose of the Dashboard
The Bank Loan Performance & Risk Analysis Dashboard is designed to provide a comprehensive overview of a financial institution’s loan portfolio. Its main goal is to help stakeholders understand the volume, quality, and financial outcomes of issued loans, enabling better decision-making around lending strategy, risk management, and operational efficiency.    

## 👩‍💻Who is it for?

- **Executives** and **Managers** monitoring key performance indicators.
- **Business Stakeholders** looking to optimize lending strategies and customer segmentation.

## ❓Questions Answered

- How many loan applications are being approved, and how many are actually getting funded?  
- Are the loans being paid back on time, or are they turning into bad loans?
- Which types of loans are most common — and are some loan purposes riskier than others?
- Does a borrower’s employment history, home ownership, or income level impact loan performance?
- Are we charging the right interest rates across different borrower segments and loan grades?
